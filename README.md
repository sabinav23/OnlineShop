# Online Shop

An online shop application built with the MVC architecture in mind, with an option to choose between an in memory repository, a file repository or a database repository (using MySql and JDBC).
As an user of the application you can: 
1. Show the list of available Products you can buy
2. Show the list of available Products you can buy of a specific category
2. Add a new Product
3. Order a list of Products (the stock will automatically update)
4. Show all Orders
